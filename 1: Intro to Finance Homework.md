* **Comapanies main traget**: Creating a more reliable way for users to handle their finances.

* 200 million raised in a single venture fund, $26.7 million raised in their Initial Coin Offering


## Business Activities:

* With the emergence of technology, traditional banking has found itself a new roadblock, which is FinTech. With the rise of technology, as well as a global pandemic that has caused the world to shut down for a long period of time, banks have run into an unprecendented scenario. That scenerio being: how can banks adapt to the sudden change in consumer behavior to not want to bank the traditional way? Digital banking has shown an increase in favoritism over traditional banking because it has proven to be faster, more reliable, as well as more effective. Crypto.com has found the solution to this, which is to offer a centralized exchange service to consumers. Like a traditional banking services, Crypto.com allows users to store their money in their crypto.com account as well as use allow users to use the native utility coin of crypto.com to trade crypto currencies as well as use it as a financial service. Unlike traditional banking, Crypto.com eliminates the need for a third party when it comes to banking. The control is in the hands of the user and not the bank. Users are also in full control of their investments and are also able to have the confidence of having their funds secured thanks to their security infrastrcture. 

* The company's intended constumers is anyone that likes knowing that their finances are safe, secure, as well as know their identity is protected. Crypto.com also targets consumers looking to switch from traditional banking to digital banking. Cryptocurrency investors are also at the top of the list, as the company offers many differnt services like crypto trading, crypto earn, crypto.com pay, crypto Visa Card, as well as their DeFi wallet. Crypto.com offers what most banks dont offer, which is a Decentralized Wallet. For advanced crypto users, the DeFi Wallet feature is a sole reason to use Crypto.coms service. Being that it is a user custodian wallet where the user is the custodian, it allows the user to have full access to their crypto keys. However, most users are fine using the centralized exchange as it eliminates the extra steps and headaches of a DeFi wallet. Crypto.com creates incentives for consumers by offering 100% reimbersments for services like Amazon Prime, Netflix, as well as Spotify. Users are just required to open a free debit card that acts like a prepaid card that can be topped up by USD or several cryptocurrencies.

* Crypto.com uses technologies like hardware security module (used to protect users crypto keys), as well custody solutions (used to hold large amounts of tokens).

## Landscape:

* Crypto.com is in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency domain.

* Blockchain and Cryptocurrency is a relatively new space but given its massive adoption over the past few years and the rise of Bitcoin, this industry is expected to gorw from 3 billion USD to 39.7 billion USD over the next 5 years.

* Other major competitors the blockchain real include Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, as well as Kraken.


## Results

* Since the birth of the company in 2016, Crypto.com has reached over 10 million global users.

* Most of these companies in this domain rely on good marketing strategies to help build their name in this industry. One of the the main marketing startegy solutions of Crypto.com was to purchase the "Crypto.com" domain name which the company bought for $12 million in 2018. Anytime an individual searches the word "cryptocurrency", Crypto.com usually is always the first thing that pops up in search engines as well as in the app stores. Crypto.com also relies are well known celebrities to promote their companies by allowing them to release their own NFT's (non-fungible tokens) on their platform. Crypto.com also signed a long-term deal with the UFC to become a Fight Kit Partner. With the explosive success the UFC has had, many new invidivuals will get exposure to the crypto.com. 

* Crypto.com is currently #19 out of 397 total exchanges. 


## Recommendations

* If i was an advisor for Crypto.com, I would suggest that Crypto.com accelerates their plans to bring their exchange services to the United States of America. Currently, US residents are able to use all the services besides the trading exchanges due to regulation. Once they bring the exchange to the United States, It will give users an extra incentive to use the service. Most users are anticipating the exchange to be able to use leverage when trading crypto, as well as using their crypto loan service. Also, I would advise Crypto.com to create a get paid to learn about crypto mechanism that allows users to watch short videos about crypto currencies to not only get paid for it but also learn how valuable this space can be.
